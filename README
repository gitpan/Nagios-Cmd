Nagios::Cmd
------------------

version 0.01
released 02 October 2003

Nagios::Cmd is a Perl module that provides a nice object oriented interface
for submitting commands to Nagios' (http://www.nagios.org) command pipe.

Consider this an alpha release, even though I'm already using it in production
and it is fairly well tested.  Depending on feedback, the phase of the moon,
and the alignment of Uranus with Sol, I may change the interface before
I deem it a 1.0 release.

PLEASE SEND ME FEEDBACK GOOD OR BAD SO I CAN MAKE IT 1.0 SOONER THAN LATER.
Thank you.

After unpacking the tarball, to install this module type:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build test
	./Build install

You may need to install Module::Build to get this up and running.  From what
I've read of MakeMaker, Module::Build is the future, so just install it.
If there is enough demand, I'll include a MakeMaker script, too.

Prerequisites:	Module::Build
